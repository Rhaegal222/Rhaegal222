### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer with a passion for programming and learning new things. I am currently a student at the University of Calabria, where I am studying Computer Science. In my free time I like to work on personal projects and learn new technologies. I'm currently focusing on web development and enterprise software development. In my future projects I would like to work on the automation of agricultural processes that can help anyone to have their own garden, in a domestic environment, and to take care of it, in order to eat what it produces.
